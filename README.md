## CS/EE 469 LAB PROJECTS

This repository holds the several projects done in the class CSEE 469. The labs will involve ARM assembly, Verilog, and C languages to program and develop the ARM microprocessor.

## LAB 1

This lab involves creating a 32 by 64 bit register file for the processor on a gate level structure. The project involves using D-flipfops, a 5:32 enabled decoder, and two large 32x64 bit to 64 multiplexors.
